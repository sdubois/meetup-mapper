		<h2>Meetup Mapper</h2>
		<p>Search for Meetup.com events in your area and view them in a map. Uses the Google Maps API, Google Places API, and Meetup API. Also provides local attraction suggestions based on user input.</p>
	
		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>
		I chose to use the Meetup API because it had excellent documentation (including a very helpful interactive feature), 
		and provided me with plenty of geolocation data. I was able to simply make a query, store it in JSON and then pull some
		GPS coordiantes from it. I then send this data to the Google Maps API, providing you with an interactive map of Meetup.com
		events in your area. When you click on an event, you get a full description of it, along with a link to view the event page
		on the Meetup website.
		</p>
		<p>
		I am also using the WeatherUnderground API to display weather around your meetup events. So if you decide to join the Rochester Unicyclists
		on a trip around the city, you won't be worried about getting caught in a storm.
